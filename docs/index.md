# Practicalli Software Engineering

![Software Engineering concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/engineering-playbook/engineering-playbook-concept.png){align=right loading=lazy style="width:240px"}

A practical guide to engineering practices and common tools for effective software development.

!!! QUOTE "Quote: John Stevenson, Practicalli"
    **Effective Communication** is the fundamental challenge for all software engineering projects

!!! QUOTE "Quote: John Stevenson, Practicalli"
    When a problem is well-defined in a language that everyone understands, it becomes far simpler to solve

!!! QUOTE "Quote: John Stevenson, Practicalli"
    **Overt** enthusiasm is to the detriment of pragmatism


??? HINT "Engineering Playbook Initiative"
    Establishing a playbook within an organisation encourages information sharing across teams and provides an effective way for disperate teams to learn from each other.

    Specific engineering plays are defined in the [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Engineering Playbook](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook){target=_blank}

??? WARNING "New Book - content under development"
    Practicalli Software Engineering was started in November 2023 in an attempt to codify the last few decades of development experience, so this will be an on-going work
